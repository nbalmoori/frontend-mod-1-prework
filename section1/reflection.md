## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?  

  - As many of us move from working back into school mode, I think this article has great suggestions for us to keep in mind. Tips I already do are having a growth mindset and view learning as a process. I strongly agree with the point that super learners teach what they know, but it's something that I don't do often. I have a hard time articulating my thoughts sometimes, so I think practicing trying to explain concepts out loud will help me retain information and be prepared to communicate effectively.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

  - I learned about numbers, strings, and Booleans.  A number can be positive, negative, zero, and use decimals, but do not input commas.  A string is text that can use letters, numbers and special characters, and should be bound by quotations.  A Boolean is a data type that is either true or false.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

  - `console.log("Hello World!")`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

  - Using two forwards slashes ``//`` before your comment will allow you to write explanations or give directions to anyone else interacting with your code, but not affect the code itself.  

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

  - A variable describes attributes of something. How old are you? A variable would be your age, or what year you were born. How tall are you? A variable would be your height, which could be measured in feet, or centimeters, etc.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

  - With Instagram, there are variables for usernames, number of followers, and number of posts. A string would hold a username, whereas a number would hold the amount of followers and posts.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

  - Concatenation is how you join together strings using the + sign.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

  - Facebook might use concatenation when showing a user's post tagged with another person:

  `console.log("nameOfUser" + " is with " + "taggedFriend")`

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

- Is the only difference between interpolation and concatenation that interpolation looks a little cleaner when you have multiple strings? Is there an instance otherwise when using one vs the other would be better?
