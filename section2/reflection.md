## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

My comfort level depends on the environment - I can ask questions one-on-one with no hesitation.  In a small group I hesitate a little bit, and in a large group I will very rarely speak up.  I tend to wait a little longer than most to ask questions.  This happens because I like to do my own research first to be respectful of people's time, and that sometimes it's hard for me to articulate my thoughts if I don't really know what I'm talking about -- and likely if I have a question on something, it's about something I don't know what I'm talking about.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

I actually did not notice that these supports were removed and that we were using more outside resources this time. I guess that is a good sign that I had learned from the previous section. I did not feel uncomfortable with how this session was set up.  I think the exercise section is where I am solidifying my knowledge through trying things out and making mistakes.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement says what to do in a given statement.  An example would be if I am requested to log in to a website and I enter my password in correctly, I can proceed into the application; however, if I do not enter my password in correctly, the system displays a message saying there was a a log-in error.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

You can add "else if" statements to add multiple conditions.  The program will check if the first condition under the "if" statement is true, and execute the designated code for that function.  If not, it will analyze the next condition, marked as "esle if", and if true will execute the designated code, or else move on to the next "else if" condition. Ultimately the final condition will be marked "else", and at that point if none of the previous conditions were true, it will execute the code in the "else" function.  

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

I could use the logical operator "&&" to check that both conditions are met, or use "||" to check if at least one condition is met.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

How problematic is it if I mix up the terms "argument" and "parameter"?
