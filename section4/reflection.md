## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

  - I think the Pomodoro technique revealed a lot about myself.  The first two 25 minute increments went really well - I was laser focused and got through material faster than I thought I would. I hit a brick wall upon round three.  All of a sudden my brain needed a salty snack, something sweet, and NEEDED my phone. I couldn't focus on anything else and started to stare at the clock waiting for my next break.  Going forward I think I will stick to two 25 increments and then take a longer break, and also work on curbing some of these addictions I have.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

  - I got through work much faster than I thought. If I could maintain that level of focus for longer, I think I could take over the world.

3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

  - An object represents a "thing" with characteristics (properties), while an array creates and stores lists of data in a single variable.

4. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
      - If all you want is the names, an array, because the list is the names in a single variable for the class.
      - If you wanted to list more information about the students, then objects would be better.
  * List of states and their capitals
      - Object, because each state has a property of a capital
  * List of things to pack for vacation
      - Array, because it is just a list (no properties)
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
      - Array, because it is just a list (no properties)
  * List of student names and their cohort
      - Object, because each name has a property of a cohort  
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
      - Object, because each ingredient has a property of a measurement
  * All my favorite restaurants
      - Object, because you might want to add properties to this list (type of food, favorite item, location)

5. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

  - I use the Mint app to keep track of my finances. There are objects for each account I have, displaying the name of the financial institution, account number, how much money I have/owe, and the date the app was last updated for each account. An example value is that Mint knows I have a credit card account with Capital One that has a $22 balance on, which was last updated 41 minutes ago.

6. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

  - Can you add a function to a class after it is declared?
