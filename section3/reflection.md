## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

- From the video, I resonated with the discussion about how it's important to compare yourself to the previous version of yourself rather than your colleagues -- realizing how much progress you made can keep you in a better positive mindset to continue to grow in the future.  

- From the article, I resonated with the idea that if you give up, then you're guaranteed to not to learn anything. It's important to recognize that time spent failing is not time wasted because you're learning what doesn't work.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

- I think I currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset in that I am open to feedback and suggestions and understand that I always have room to grow and will never know everything. I currently don't demonstrate a Growth Mindset when I get frustrated too easily -- I thrive when I'm doing well at something, but once something gets too confusing I can get trapped into that set mindset where I have doubts that I am not smart enough to ever understand a topic.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

- Instagram probably uses arrays for a user's follower list.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

- An Array method can update an array using code.  There are various methods you can use to add items to a list, remove items from the list, change the order of the list, etc.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

- The purpose of a loop is to run a specific code multiple times. You would use a loop in conjunction with an array when you want to run code specific to individual items in the array.  You would use a loop without an array if you're trying to run the same exact line of code multiple times.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

- A loop lets the computer repeat a line of code for you instead of you having to enter it in by yourself each time.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

- Is the splice method the best way to change an item in the middle of an array, or is there a better/easier method?
